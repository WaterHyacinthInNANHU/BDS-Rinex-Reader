	 1 - for Monday
	 2 - for Tuesday
	 3 - for Wednesday
	 4 - for Thursday
	 5 - for Friday
	 6 - for Saturday
  HH   = two-digit hour

DATA FORMAT
===========

The observation and navigation files are in RINEX format version 2.11
For format details see ftp://www.igs.org/pub/data/format/rinex211.txt

IGS Ephemeris data files are supplied in the SP3 format version c.
For format details see ftp://www.igs.org/pub/data/format/sp3c.txt


SOFTWARE TO TRANSFORM EPHEMERIS FILES from SP3c to SP3a AVAILABLE
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Since January 29th, 2006 the International GNSS Service (IGS) began
making its precise ephemeris files available only in the SP3-c format.  

To convert a file from SP3-c format to the older SP3-a format, there is a 
compiled executable file for Windows NT/2000/XP, and source code is also 
available at:
